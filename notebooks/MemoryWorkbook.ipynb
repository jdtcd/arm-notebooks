    "This workbook is a proof-of-concept to test the capabilities of interactive notebooks for the teaching of ARM Assembly Language. It is paired with a questionnaire that we invite you to fill out after your try out the notebook. In this notebook you will find a series of exercises that will help you understand some concepts on memory copying. Feel free to work through the exercises at your own pace, and do not feel obliged to finish them if you do not have time! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are curious to know how this all works and all the cool stuff you can do with this notebook, you can go through the **Introduction** notebook you will find in the same folder as this notebook. I am also free to chat anytime you see me demonstrating at your lab with Prof. Dukes!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part of Samuel Alarco's undergraduate final year project at Trinity College Dublin. I am very grateful for all the students trying out this tool, and I sincerely hope it is useful for your study of ARM assembly. Filling out the survey accompanying this exercise would really help me out for my project. If you have any concerns or doubt, do not hesitate in contacting me at alarcocs@tcd.ie .\n",
